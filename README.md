# AngularAngularjsHybrid

This project is to showcase how to run AngularJS and Angular applications together.
It demonstrates that you can keep your older AngularJS pages, controllers, etc and use Angular to create your new pages.

Live example here: (home and checkout are Angular, album and pricing are AngularJS)
