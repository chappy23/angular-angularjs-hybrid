# AngularAngularjsHybrid

This project is to showcase how to run AngularJS and Angular applications together.

At my current workplace I was tasked with retaining the old AngularJS app and trying to use a modern JS framework for the new pages that we would be creating.

Live example here: (home and checkout are Angular, album and pricing are AngularJS)
