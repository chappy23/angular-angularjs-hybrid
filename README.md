# Angular/AngularJS Hybrid

This project showcases how you can get an AngularJS app to run within an Angular app with working routes. At my workplace I was responsible with finding a solution to keep the legacy AngularJS code the same and use new tech to develop the new pages and this was the solution that we used, although on a smaller scale.

With a bit of fiddling you can essentially drop your AngularJS app into the Ng1 folder, configure the routes and it should be good to go.

Live example here: (home and checkout are Angular, album and pricing are AngularJS)
